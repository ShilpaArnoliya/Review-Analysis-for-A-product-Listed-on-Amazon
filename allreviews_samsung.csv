  I bought this128 GB Samsung Memory card in April 2019 thinking that its at lowest price but disappointed when price dropped more after i bought it.  Further, now since October 2019 card is showing ""corrupted"" status after 73GB data. Data again shows when I unmount and mount card. But again shows Corrupted next day.Very disappointed by SAMSUNG for this.Therefore I changed rating to 2 star only.

  I purchased this 128GB samsung Sd Card and the storage capacity is only 32GB though the chip i received is a 128GB card. Big time hardware fault. I am unable to return this device since the time has lapsed now. I want amazon folks to act on this. Really disappointed with Samsung and Amazon for bad service and advice people to rethink/verify before buying this product.

  i never trusted samsung products for storage (since once my hard drive died in just 1 1/2 years). i thought it might have changed now. evo series looked premium & the price was also a little premium as compared to other ones so i thought to give it a try....but sadly after 2 years of use it died. my stopped detecting it suddenly....i tried hooking it up on my pc but that didn't worked either. i did every thing i could to revive it but all in vain. i didnt used the card that much. only some apps were installed in it. no songs, videos or photos.... but still it died...

  Beats me how some people come to review products and claim that 32gb sdcard had only 29 gb space. how 64gb pen drive has 57 gb space. If you dont have technical knowledge, do your research and find out. Dont bring your ignorance to undermine good products because your brain is tiny. Every storage device has less capacity than advertised. This is because every storage device has to store some other identifying information which defines its own identity and the identity of its contents. It keeps some space reserved for specific reasons. Even your phone storage and laptop HDD storage works similarly. Open your selfie phone when you pout on it and check its storage, then downvote it on commerce websites because you have an ignorant arrogant tiny brain.As far as this product is concerned, its value for money and works great. I did not check read write speeds because I am not crazy or paranoid and these products are not supposed to have lightening speeds. Recommended.

  I recently purchase Samsung EVO Plus Grade 3 Class 10 128GB MicroSDXC Memory Card. Here is my review about the  Samsung memory card:Pros:*I got a free adapter with this card as it mentioned in product's description.*128 GB enough space to put my photo, videos and other data.*smooth installing, no wait for installationCons:*I feel slow speed while transferring data from my Laptop to this MicroSDXC Memory Card while they mentioned Class10 which is not justifiable here.

  Don't buy this product. If you store an mobile app data on sd card then it allows to access mobile, it frequently restart while using app stored on sd card. The SD card I received may be duplicate the reasons is On cover wrote made in Korea but when look to sd card its wrote made in Philippines and SD card adapter its written made in China. I test it 3 devices it shows same behavior, its frequently switching off mobile. Its not good for mobile. Also it increases the time of charging of mobile. From these things I reach to the conclusion its not original Samsung card. If you love your mobile and devices then don't use this card. I recommend Strontium card that best in use.

  This is a proper storage card, with no issues in data transfer and storage. Rate of data transmission is good, can be used as phones default storage with no loss in speed/efficiency.Durability is great, won't break on falling or under a bit pressure, water proof - just dry it out first before using. I bought the 64 gb variant at offer price, one gets about 61gb depending on the phone with which you are using. On offer price of Rs 949 should buy it.

  I was earlier sent a fake card which I identified in 1 second.Then I ordered a replacement online through Amazon and now I finally got an ORIGINAL Samsung card.I've attached photos the real card's packaging, so you may decide wisely what card you're getting... If you feel something is wrong (detail not matching order, wrong fonts, bad quality print, etc.) return it by going to ""My order"" on Amazon and ask for original one immediately....The write speed, as guaranteed by U3 marking should be above 30MB/ second as per Memory card association.In my card it was claimed to be 90MB/ second on package, and 100MB/ second read speed.Of course, on an older system with no so accurate readers, you get around 20 MB/ second maximum. But on newer mobiles phones, you do get upto 60-90 MB/second or so.This card is good for phones supporting SDXC, and remember, it may also be supported on phones which claim to support much less.Example, My Redmi 2 Prime claimed to support only 32GB, and guess what, 64 and even 128 GB cards from both Samsung and Sandisk were supported and ran awesome!! Please remember SDXC standard supports very high capacities, maybe upto 512 GB. SDHC, an older standard supports only upto 32GB.Card was made in Phillipines. A useful SD adaptor (with a writing-lock switch) was supplied which was made in China.Capacity that came was 119GB, which is slightly more than 128,000,000,000 bytes.(The difference in capacity is due to 1024 bytes=1KB and 1024KB= 1MB and 1024 MB = 1GB).

  First off the average user or photographer will have no trouble with this card, as it has great storage capacity. I've been using one for about a year now and it still performs well, although with a few hiccups here and there. However, this is not a fast card, and I cannot recommend it for any professional use. Using burst mode on my Nikon (shooting RAW) shows a considerable lag between the shots being taken and written to the card - so you'll be severely limited in your shooting capacity. It also takes a considerable amount of time to copy data on/off so the ""100MB/s"" sales pitch is just a gimmick.Occasionally, the card refuses to read on my camera, for no apparent reason.That being said this is a very affordable option for a bit of hobby photography or for storing your files, but I wouldn't trust its reliability and I certainly don't recommend it for professional work. Buy something like a Samsung Pro SDXC or PNY card for that instead.

  Product shipment fast. Most Samsung card in local store are duplicates. This one from Appario found original. Made in Philippines. Card i got from Malaysia last year made in Malaysia from Samsung had 95 and 83mbps. Indian version seem little slow . I found read speed surprisingly low than san disk. But SanDisk write speed is 35mbps in india for same price. Sandisk A1 card. So I'm okey with overall. SanDisk read is always above 70mbps in A1 card above 64gb. 32 gb cards of both brands have less speed. I don't know y. Speed is depend on size of card

  Go through my review once before buying this memory card.Using this memory card since a month now. Packaging has hologram so I'm relieved about genuineness. This card was my first choice as it supports 4K recording so I'm using it in both action camera and mobile.Performance : 95%Quality : 95%Features : 90%Value for money : 95%Overall Rating: 94%PERFORMANCE :I did benchmark tests & performance was considerable. Read & write speeds are not what Samsung advertised but it's acceptable as performance varies with many factors.BENCHMARK RESULT :Read : 84 MB/sWrite : 42 MB/s[ Check screenshots added with review ]HARDWARE :This memory card is Class 10 UHS - I U3 certified. It's water-proof, temperature proof, magnet proof and X-Ray proof as well so I'm not worried about any loss of data under such conditions.FINAL VERDICT :Samsung Evo Plus is an easy buy because it's fast enough for a smartphone or tablet and action camera as well. It comes with a full-size SD adapter, so don't worry about buying one separately and also it comes with 10 year warranty for peace of mind.I hope this helped you.

The funniest part is, you can see the content on a laptop, but can't write, delete or even format (tried DOS formatting also). When inserted in the phone, it's not detected. Tried inserting in several phones, so no issue with the phone. Incidentally, the phone is also a high-end Samsung. Really frustrated with the quality.

  First of all thank Amazon for wonderful fast delivery before time.  The product is good  I am already using samsung 4 memory cards of 16GB, 32GB,  64 GB and this new one 64GB .  Samsung is a good brand like sandisk is also a good one but it charge prices more than other brands that is too bad,  not fair enough.  Coming to durability I'm using others from past 5 yrs no issues till now,  next one about its quality very good,  now. If I talk about  about  it's storage capacity it disappoints me little bit as it actually offers 59GB(approx)  out 64GB ,I don't know what the hell is remaining 5Gb,  they are doing means it contains application or system apps.  But still 5GB is a very big storage which is proving to be unuseful.  Otherwise overall good.

  The packaging was really good even for a memory card which one can easily misunderstand for a mobile or similar stuff visuall.However there are a lot of fake ones available so in order to find out which one is real and which is fake check the sides of the memory card.The real ones edges will be white in colour while the fake ones have black coloured edges.Fast data transferring Adapter is include with this card.Pros:-1- The read/write speed of the card through the adapter is around 50/25 mbps.2- The read/write speed of the card through my mobile ZenFone 2 ZE550ML variant with the original cable is around 40/28 mbps well technically it is more than what we get through the original adapter.3- The card really is water proof since I accidentally dropped a glass of water on it and it was still working fine without any problems.4-This card is really fast so fast that I have like 40 movies on my mobile(literally and I am not joking) 10 GB of video songs and a few pictures and stuff and even with only 300 MB of free space the memory card never hangs.5- I usually carry a lot of movies and compressed RAR files I have like roughly 900 files on my memory card right now and I was able to copy around 40 GB of this data using my mobile cable not THROUGH a adapter in 30 minutes give or take 3 minutes from my pc to the card.6- I copied the same data back to my pc using the same setup and was able to copy them all in comically the same amount of time.

  The problem with this memory card is highspeed recording. I am using it in my note 8 and when I try to record slowmotion videos, the recording gets stuck instead of being a smooth one. I have used sandisk and transcend memory cards instead of this for the same purpose without any problems. Ofcourse the work around is to record it directly to your phone storage instead of the external card. So it's ok. But do consider the above mentioned point before purchase. For any other work this card is quite good.

They always deliver the product at home . But amazon courier boy always left the product here and there and they dont mind to inform us where they left our product and later  We have to search for it asking everyone. Especially this things happen when we order on prepaid. So, I prefer cash on delivery than prepaid. That is the only minus point, otherwise every thing is fine.

  The memory card worked fine for 8 months (October 2018- June 2019 ), after which I lost 28 gb data overnight, followed by the remaining 29 gb in the following 2 days (for which I had the foresight to take backup, thank God), and then the card got corrupted. I formatted it on my phone and started using it again, thinking all was well now. Well guess what, I lost all data AGAIN AFTER FORMATTING and the card again being shown ""corrupted"" on my phone. What use is a memory card if I have to take backup of everything I store on it ? If I had to take backup of my storage source (card) everytime I used it, wouldn't i just use the backup source as my primary storage instead ? Horrible product from Samsung that has managed to give me a new level of trust issues. I don't have the time nor energy to pursue the warranty which I'm expecting will turn out to be another scam on Samsung's part. Waste of time, waste of money and a new lesson in life: always take backup, especially while using sh*t products from Samsung.

  Capacity and working was goodThe packaging was really good even for a memory card which one can easily misunderstand for a mobile or similar stuff visuall.However there are a lot of fake ones available so in order to find out which one is real and which is fake check the sides of the memory card.The real ones edges will be white in colour while the fake ones have black coloured edges.Fast data transferring Adapter is include with this card.Pros:-1- The read/write speed of the card through the adapter is around 50/25 mbps.2- The read/write speed of the card through my mobile ZenFone 2 ZE550ML variant with the original cable is around 40/28 mbps well technically it is more than what we get through the original adapter.3- The card really is water proof since I accidentally dropped a glass of water on it and it was still working fine without any problems.4-This card is really fast so fast that I have like 40 movies on my mobile(literally and I am not joking) 10 GB of video songs and a few pictures and stuff and even with only 300 MB of free space the memory card never hangs.5- I usually carry a lot of movies and compressed RAR files I have like roughly 900 files on my memory card right now and I was able to copy around 40 GB of this data using my mobile cable not THROUGH a adapter in 30 minutes give or take 3 minutes from my pc to the card.6- I copied the same data back to my pc using the same setup and was able to copy them all in comically the same amount of time.160 people found this helpful

  It has only been a couple of months when I bought this card so can’t comment on durability.  All cards are equally easy to use so here also, nothing can be said about this particular product. As regards last point of storage capacity, when I am buying 64 GB card, it will give me 64 GB storage space so what is so special about it?Anyway, this card is fast enough for my highest quality full HD video being streamed from my video camera or even from DSLR.

  Both the 64GB memory card and adapter are in good condition. At Rs 699 got a substantial discount the MRP being Rs 1899. Recorded 4K UHD videos on my Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. Could play it back without any lag. Copied to my old Windows 7 Lenovo Z580 laptop using the adapter in the microSD card slot. Could save the 4K file easily on the laptop. Tried the memory card + adapter in my DSLR Canon 1300 D. Saves pics fast and easy. Don't know whether it could record 4K UHD videos in the card as my DSLR does'nt have that high resolution. But the mobile does. 4KUHS 1 requires 4.2 gb for a 01 hr video and 4K UHD requires around 32 GB for the same duration. The microSD card has been manufactured in the Phillipines and has a 10 yr warranty. But the adapter is of Chinese make and has a warranty of only 01 yr. Edges of the microSD card are white. So its definitely an original Samsung one. It could be a good back up card for even professional photographers.

  Good read and write speed.Connected the 128 GB sd card to the USB 3 port using a USB 3 card reader and copied mp4 and mkv video files to it and the card showed a write speed in between 60 and 66 MB/s.While copying from the SD card to HDD(7200 RPM HDD), the write speed is in between 65 and 75 MB/s. I also tested the 64 GB U3 variant and it showed a write speed in between 55 and 65 MB/s while copying to the card. So in my case, the 128 GB card showed good results. Both the cards seem to be original and I am satisfied with the quality of the products. I had a Samsung 128 GB U1 class Micro Sd card which got corrupted and and did not even last one year. Hope this will  last long.

  Remember that in SD Cards, there are Classes and Grades and UHS I and II and... UGH!  Gets a bit crazy. I think right now Class V90 UHS II are fastest, but really even the UHS I cards are PLENTY fast enough unless you're recording 4K video or you're always copying gigs and gigs regularly... and they're much cheaper too!So... this card was exactly as described.  Comes with bigger SD adapter so you can use in PC or phone/tablet.  Tested it using some free tools and its speed is what it should be.  Of course you don't get the actual advertised capacity in ANY storage device you buy, which is ridiculous, but that's the way it is.Had a couple SanDisk cards and one failed after almost five years (which is not too bad)... thought I'd try Samsung this time since it is so well-rated.I will update my review if things change, but so far I'm happy with this card... have pounded it hard over the past couple days and it's doing great!  Doesn't get hot either.I think you will not be disappointed.  Thanks, and please click ""Helpful"" below...

Not checked on PC.Write Speed= Speed fluctuates from 10 MB/s to 60 MB/s, (on average 30 to 40+ MB/s) from phone's internal storage to the card, though it depends on the file system, but it was really very fast. One can easily transfer very huge files in seconds.Packaging = Packaging was decent enough from the seller and as usual from the manufacturer.Card Adapter= Made in China, haven't used it yet.My verdict= Perfectly good and one must go for it.

  Like the fact that had no problems with the card,just popped it into my phone and it was good to go. Available storage about 63GB. Seems to be original Samsung, card made in Philippines,adapter made in China. It's a relatively new card manufactured in May '19.Smooth HD and 4K UHD video shooting with no stutter or lag. Slow motion vids also work fine. Haven't transferred any files so can't comment but rated read 100 Mb/s and 60 Mb/s write speed should be fast enough for most.Got this after my old Samsung Evo plus 32 GB filled up and expecting this to last for years also. Durable card as it is water/magnet/x-ray proof and can withstand very low or high temperatures. Comes with 10yr warranty and you can trust Samsung,leading manufacturer of storage devices. Though the mrp was 1899/-, got a deal at 700. Definitely good value. No wonder this card comes up top in most reviews.Only wish packaging was improved as it arrived in only a thin plastic cover, but no complaints as product is working fine.😃

  You should prefer buying 64 GB upwards rather than 32, because the 32 GB one gets used up pretty easily. For people you store less of data in their device I would suggest 32 GB but even if you buy a 64 its totally worth it, a little bit more space on your device won't hurt you. Now a days every devices support min. 128 GB on external storage so buying a 64 GB wont cause any compatible issues but if you need to verify it I'll suggest you google your device external storage capacity. No offence but I'll choose Samsung over Sandisk because all those Sandisk cards I bought earlier had gone corrupted usually on a usage of between 1 - 2 years, so i would suggest you buying Samsung memory cards.

  Samsung will never fail to impress their customers. Its perfect memory card for everyday use and some heavy task like storage for games. Although rated speed is 100 MBPS, it provides 20-30 MBPS Read speed and 10-15 MBPS write speed. Thats not much impressive.There's only one cons to this card that initialization/ detection is quite slow. I can't actually blame the technology though because error checking on a 64 gb storage will obviously be complex and time consuming.Overall, great shopping experience with amazon and Samsung.

  Whatever written about reading and writing speed, is absolutely correct. Very much satisfied with this product, if the writing speed could b above 20mbps , then it would b nice. Anyway, this product manages to meet my satisfaction. But cant tell when this product gets corrupted., because most f the samsung cards gets corrupted without any reason, not quickly though. But it will, someday may b after a year or some months.

  A very good product was Samsung. When my previous card (also Samsung) stopped working, I ordered a 32 GB card to replace my 16 GB card. The card was super easy to install and works great! It was almost the same rate as rivals but was delivered within a day; so I opted for it as even a day with SD card in phone is difficult. I move all movies, videos and apps on the card to keep internal memory free. With so much free space, I have to think about what to install next?

  After 4 months of usage, the SD has stopped working. Samsung claims it is out of warranty and is not willing to help in the case.The seller made a mistake on the printed bill as he mentioned the wrong serial number, now with no contact info of the seller samsung is not accepting the invoice issued.Please help in this case and I shall rewrite a review once the whole issue is resolved.

  It's a class 10 u3 card which means it's for perfect. Speed is incredible. I'm using it in my Nintendo switch and I've got expected performance.Samsung memory cards are more durable than others so unless you are extremely harsh, these cards can take mild punishment like moisture and dirt (not too much but still more than cheap Chinese products).If you have to buy a new memory card, do not buy anything below 64 gb. I initially bought a 32gb card but quickly changed my mind.

  Got what I paid for. Samsung is a brand you can trust with memory, be it SSDs or memory cards.Using this card in my mobile, which formatted the card to be used as internal storage.So I am using this to mostly store apps.Read & Write speeds are best in class, and its a reliable memory card.fully satisfied.If you are confused between Sandisk Ultra vs Samsung,go with Samsung for the following reasons -1. This card came out later, which means it an updated model as compared to Sandisk ultra.2. Samsung is U3 Speed class which is faster than Sandisk's U1. (Don't confuse with UHS - 1 )3. Samsung 64 GB is 750Rs, Sandisk 64 Gb is 800Rs4. Sandisk Ultra card was released more than 10 years ago so it is optimized for Class 10 , where as Samsung EVO is UHS - 1, which is a more updated standard.5. Talking about A1 Speed certification, which is basically mobile Application write and read performance based on Random reads and write speeds, Even though Samsung lacks this and Sandisk ultra has an A1 certification, Check the Random read and write speed benchmarks done using the below links, Samsung speeds are beating the competition by miles.Benchmarks -samsung-evo-plus-microsd-review at hothardware dot comwiki/benchmarks/microsd-cards at pidramble dot comVerify your own Samsung SD card as genuine using Samsung's official software -just google Samsung sd card checker

  By far one of the best memory cards I have purchased. A great investment. You get 119GB of usable space. It's reliable and I haven't lost data stored on this at all. I was using the Sandisk 64GB Extreme Pro class 10 A card in my GoPro hero 7 black earlier and there were numerous times where the data stored was simply lost or the file would be corrupted. That's when I bought the Samsung card and it's been a beauty to have.

  The storage is 29.83GB total. I know the rest is used for system files etc but it's 32GB it should be atleast 30.5GB. Odk.Also, the reading and writing speed mentioned are wrong. It's actually very less that that. It's okay, yes but not what mentioned. Never got up to the mentioned reading or writing speed.Overall I guess it's alright for the price. The free adapter with it is amazing and very helpful if you own a camera or laptop or anything that uses that type of SD card.

  I received it intact and properly packed in a bubble wrap which was put in a plastic amazon pouch. The card was as expected and I have already started using it. It works as it is supposed to.Recently, I had to backup all the data from it to my laptop, and I noticed the speed to be around 40 to 70 Mpbs not 90 or hundred. However, this may be dependent on many other aspects like the storage where you are transferring it, your laptop's response and also the tiny and big files that are being transferred. The data size was around 16 gb which had many folders and many small and large files.The write speed I don't remember properly buy it was also around 40 to 50 Mbps.

  Any Samsung product especially in the SDXC memory card segment is top notch. This 128 GB SDXC memory card is not an exception. Works like a gem in my RN5P. However this product like almost all others have a dynamic pricing strategy. I bought this for 3299/- in June. However during the Amazon Prime Sale from 16th July onwards, it dropped to 2799/-. Again at the time of writing this review it is 2999/-. Inspite of the fluctuations in price, this SDXC memory card is a great addition especially for those who take lots of pictures and videos.

  After 4 Months use, I will not recommend Samsung EVO Plus Grade 3 Class 10 128GB MicroSDXC Memory Card with SD Adapter (MB-MC128GA/IN). This memory card is not perform as per specified and responsible for slowing down my phone. Each time when I restart my phone it takes almost 5-7 min to fully read card ( at present I stored only 40GB of data out of 128 GB on max). Apps stored in card are also behave unexpected and phone performance is down to hell. Thanks Amazon for providing such a bad product to your customers.

  Great product!!! And quick delivery. Out of 128 GB, ultimately I got 119 GB which is obvious. 9 GB is needed for its own setup. Everyone should understand this. Without knowing many people blame the product. And after inserting the memory card, it shows ""Blank card"" and after that one format is needed to erase and freshly start the card. This is a systematic procedure. Everyone should know these things also before blaming. Before doing these formalities don't blame. Thank you Amazon!

  A fairly good buy for ₹699. Packaging included a SD adapter along with the MicroSD card.Speeds during read were as high as 85MBps which is good for the price. Write speeds were sustained at around 19MBps during large file transfers.The card does suffer speed drops to speeds as low as 1MBps during multiple small file transfers which is understandable. Overall, given the price point, it's a good card for multimedia usage.

  First of all don't believe those comments who told or showed low write speed, they used 2.0 card reader to check the speed but they don't know the maximum speed of USB 2.0 is less than 30 Mbps.The card is very good, the read speed is lower than advertised but what we mainly need is write speed which is much higher.My my opinion its a great sd card for DSLRs or Action Cameras.

  Never ever buy Samsung memory card. If there is a problem in your memory card, then Samsung says that you will have to go to Lucknow or Ghaziabad by taking a bill of paper.
